### DevSecOps
- DevSecOps is the culture of integrating security practices within the DevOps process. Simply it is DevOps with the lens of security. 
- Doing DevOps with no preference for security is not a complete DevOps. DevOps cycle with added Security is DevSecOps. A good devsecops approach brings together tools, processes, and culture.

### MLOps
- In short DevOps mean, shorten the process of software development lifecycle by providing the service of continuous integration and continuous delivery in production.
- DevOps = Development + Operation.
- MLOps = Machine Learning + Development + Operation.

### DataOps
- DataOps is a collection of technical practices, workflows, cultural norms, and architectural patterns that enable:
 - Rapid innovation and experimentation delivering new insights to customers with increasing velocity.
 - Extremely high data quality and very low error rates.
 - Collaboration across complex arrays of people, technology, and environments.
 - Clear measurement, monitoring, and transparency of results.
 
 ### Microservices
 - Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.
 - Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
 
 ### Web Service (WS)
  - a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet.
