## Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

 The software development life cycle (SDLC) explains the different stages of software development. This framework is important because it covers the planning, building, deployment, and maintenance of the software. The SDLC delivers high-quality software by creating it in a systematic manner.

- UML diagrams:
  - Entity relationship diagram (ERD)
  - Use case diagram
  - Sequence diagram
  - Activity diagram

###  Programming Language vs Framework :
- programming languages are nothing more than a set of rules by which you make a computer do what you want.
- Frameworks are tools that help to increase the efficiency of using a specific language, be it JavaScript, PHP, or Python. However, they help to achieve incredible results.
- We can say that, frameworks are not magic pills. They won’t build an app for you and won’t free programmers from the need to plan the system architecture in detail.

### Design Patterns vs. Architecture Patterns :
- Design Patterns :
  - Design Patterns are well known patterns for solving technical problems in a way that has proven itself many times. --
  - Design patterns are common design structures and practices that make for creating reusable Object-Oriented software. 
  - Design patterns can be used to solve smaller problems throughout the application, and are much easier to inject, change, add than the overall architecture. 
  
- Architecture Patterns :
  - architecture patterns are well known patterns for solving software application architecture problems. 
  - Software application architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements. 
  - Application's architecture is the overall 'organization' of the code. 
  - The architecture typically needs to be decided up front and often is difficult to change once the application is built.
