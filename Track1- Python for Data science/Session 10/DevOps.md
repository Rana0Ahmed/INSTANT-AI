DevOps is an alternative approach to the software development workflow, improving speed, efficiency, and productivity. Integrating two previously siloed roles — development and operations — DevOps also reduces the number of steps in the software lifecycle.

- In Coding phase  
  - code development and review.
  - source code management tools.
  - code merging.
  - 
- In Building phase
    - continuous integration tools (like Jenkins).
    - build status.
   
- In Testing phase 
  - continuous testing tools (like QuerySurge, Selenium, Cucumber, JMeter) that provide feedback on business risks.
   
- In Packaging phase
   - artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.
   - 
- In Releasing phase 
   - change management, release approvals, release automation.
   - 
- In Configuring phase
   - infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools.
   - 
- In Monitoring phase
   - applications performance monitoring, end-user experience.

 # Agile vs. DevOps


|Parameter|	Agile	|DevOps|
|----------|---------|-----|
|What is it?	|iterative approach which focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.|DevOps is considered a practice of bringing development and operations teams together.|
|Purpose|helps to manage complex projects.|central concept is to manage end-to-end engineering processes.|
|Task	|	Agile process focusses on constant changes.|DevOps focuses on constant testing and delivery.|
|Implementation	|	Agile method can be implemented within a range of tactical frameworks like a sprint, safe and scrum.|The primary goal of DevOps is to focus on collaboration, so it doesn’t have any commonly accepted framework.|
|Duration|Agile development is managed in units of “sprints.” This time is much less than a month for each sprint.|DevOps strives for deadlines and benchmarks with major releases. The ideal goal is to deliver code to production DAILY or every few hours.|
|Feedback	|Feedback is given by the customer.	|Feedback comes from the internal team.|
|Focus|It focuses on functional and non-function readiness.|It focuses more on operational and business readiness.|
|Quality|Agile produces better applications suites with the desired requirements.|DevOps, along with automation and early bug removal, contributes to creating better quality.|
