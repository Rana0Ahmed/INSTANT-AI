## Session content:
### Continue Data structures. (Map, Graph, Tree)
### Data structures implementation.

## Continue Data structures Types:
### Map
- Fastest data structure after Set/Vectors/Arrays.

- Uses Pointers.

- Can't repeat the same key name.

- like Dictionary in python.

- Sort by Keys.

- It takes log(N) to Add, Delete, Access elements.

- Its implementation varies from one programming language to another.

- Have more 2 Types :

  1-Unordered Map

    - Fastest.

    - Can't repeat the same key name.

    - Don't sort the data.

 2-MultiMap

    - Can repeat the same key name many times.

### Graph
- Uses Pointers.

- Non-linear data structure.

- All elements are linked together.

- We get speed ,flexibility but at the expense of Memory.

- Total taken places in memory are n(n-1) in the worst case.

- Represented in memory as Adjacency Matrix / Adjacency List.

- Have 2 Types :

  1-Directed / Undirected

  2-Weighted / Unweighted

- Graph traversal algorithms are DFS and BFS.

- Refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.

### Tree
- Special kind of graph.

- There are no cycle; If I were in node B, I wouldn't access node A.

- In binary tree takes log(N) to Add, Delete, Access elements.

- e.g. Data representation in data base.

### Tasks:
1-How to sort dictionary by keys.

2-Compare between Adjacency Matrix/List (Speed, Time, Memory, Applications).

3-How does DFS and BFS work.

4-Create your own library and use it.

5-Create a function receives stack elements as inputs from user while not equal to zero.

6-Implement Unordered/Multi set in Python.
