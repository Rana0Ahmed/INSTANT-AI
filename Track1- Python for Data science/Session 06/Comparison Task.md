|Stands for|Depth First Search|Breadth-First Search|
|Approach used|It works on the concept of LIFO (Last In First Out).|It works on the concept of FIFO (First In First Out).|
|Data Structure|Stack data structure.|Queue data structure|
|Memory|DFS requires less memory.|BFS requires more memory.|
|Speed|DFS is fast as compared to BFS.|BFS is slow as compared to DFS.|
