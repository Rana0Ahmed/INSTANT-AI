`Subject`: Linear_regression

## Notes
- **AI**
  - AI to `Generalization` (generalize a solution) and `Optimization` (the solution is the optimal solution)
  - The best solution which maximize profit and minimize cost
- **AGI** (Artificial Genreal Intelligence)
  - AI : General Solution for Specific Problem
     - Example: Face recognition 
  - AI : General Solutuin for Gneral Problems ( AGI )

- **Types of learning**
  - Supervised learning (defined by its use of labeled dataset     
     1- `Classification` :to train the model to choose correct answer between specific answers
       - Binary classification :to categorize new observations into one of two classes. 
       - Categorical classification :to categorize new observations for more than two classes
      
     2- `Regression` : Calculate Actual value
    
  - Unsupervised learning (unlabeled data sets)
    - Clustering ( Grouping ) : Divide data into groups. 
  - Self Supervised [Reinforcement learning, Q learning] (model corrects itself)
- **Types of models:** 
  - Statistical Model
  - Non Statistical Model 


## Tasks

- What is Semi-supervised learning
- Examples for Non Statistical Models
- Solve an example with one variable ([canada_per_capita_income](https://github.com/Rana0Ahmed/INSTANT-AI/tree/main/Track%204_%20Machine%20Learning/Session%2001/canada_per_capita_income%20(one%20variable))) for Linear_regression
- Solve an example with multiple variables ([hiring](https://github.com/Rana0Ahmed/INSTANT-AI/tree/main/Track%204_%20Machine%20Learning/Session%2001/hiring%20(multiple%20variables))) for Linear_regression
