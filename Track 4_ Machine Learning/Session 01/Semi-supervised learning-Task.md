## Semi-Supervised Learning

- Semi-supervised learning is a broad category of machine learning methods that makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data, it is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning methods
- Semi-supervised learning uses pseudo labeling to train the model with less labeled training data than supervised learning

- The whole working of semi-supervised learning
  - It trains the model with less amount of training data similar to the supervised learning models. The training continues until the model gives accurate results
  - The algorithms use the unlabeled dataset with pseudo labels in the next step, and now the result may not be accurate
  - The labels from labeled training data and pseudo labels data are linked together
  - The input data in labeled training data and unlabeled training data are also linked
  - In the end, again train the model with the new combined input as did in the first step. It will reduce errors and improve the accuracy of the model
