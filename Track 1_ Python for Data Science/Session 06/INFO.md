`Topic`: Data structures 


## Notes
 - Continue Data structures. (Map, Graph, Tree)
 - Data structures implementation.
 - Continue Data structures Types:
 - **Map** 
    - Fastest data structure after Set/Vectors/Arrays.
    - Uses Pointers.
    - Can't repeat the same key name.
    - like Dictionary in python.
    - Sort by Keys.
    - It takes log(N) to Add, Delete, Access elements.
    - Its implementation varies from one programming language to another.
    - Have more 2 Types :

       1-Unordered Map
       - Fastest.
       - Can't repeat the same key name.
       - Don't sort the data.

      2-MultiMap
       - Can repeat the same key name many times.

- **Graph**
  - Uses Pointers.
  - Non-linear data structure.
  - All elements are linked together.
  - We get speed ,flexibility but at the expense of Memory.
  - Total taken places in memory are n(n-1) in the worst case.
  - Represented in memory as Adjacency Matrix / Adjacency List.
  - Have 2 Types :

    1-Directed / Undirected

    2-Weighted / Unweighted

  - Graph traversal algorithms are DFS and BFS.
  - Refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.

- **Tree**
  - Special kind of graph.
  - There are no cycle; If I were in node B, I wouldn't access node A.
  - In binary tree takes log(N) to Add, Delete, Access elements.
  - e.g. Data representation in data base.

## Tasks
- How to sort dictionary by keys.
- Compare between Adjacency Matrix/List (Speed, Time, Memory, Applications).
- How does DFS and BFS work.
- Create your own library and use it.
- Create a function receives stack elements as inputs from user while not equal to zero.
- Implement Unordered/Multi set in Python.
