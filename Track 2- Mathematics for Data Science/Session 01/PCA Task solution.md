## What is PCA and how it works

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) :

- It is a statistical procedure that allows you to summarize the information content in large data tables by means of a smaller set of “summary indices” that can be more easily visualized and analyzed. 
- By transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.
- The Benefits of PCA :
  - By reducing the dimensionality of the data, PCA enables us to better generalize machine learning models. This helps us deal with the “curse of dimensionality”.
  - PCA can help us improve performance at a very low cost of model accuracy. 
  - Reduction of noise in the data, feature selection (to a certain extent), and the ability to produce independent, uncorrelated features of the data. 
  - PCA allows us to visualize data and allow for the inspection of clustering/classification algorithms.
- PCA Use Cases :
  - Improve Algorithm Runtime
  - Improve Classification Accuracy
  - Visualization
  - Reduce Noise in Data
  - Feature Selection
